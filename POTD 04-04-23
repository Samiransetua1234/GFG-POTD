approach here is to find the violation points (violation point is when your current char doesn't match with last char or previous char).
using a for loop just find the violation points and make a count of it.
then just return (count/2)+1 if it's a even and return (count/2)+2 if it's a odd.
CODE

class Solution{
    int minSteps(String str) {
        //Write your code here
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < str.length(); i++){
            if(str.charAt(i-1) != str.charAt(i)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return (count %2 == 0)? (count/2)+1: (count/2)+2;
    }
}
